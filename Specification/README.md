# BrAPI Overview

The Breeding API specifies a standard interface for plant phenotype/genotype databases to serve 
their data to crop breeding applications. It is a <i>shared</i>, <i>open</i> API, to be
used by all data providers and data consumers who wish to participate. Initiated in May 2014, it is
currently in an actively developing state, so now is the time for potential participants to help
shape the specifications to ensure their needs are addressed. The listserve for discussions and 
announcements is at http://mail2.sgn.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/plant-breeding-api .
Additional documentation is in the <a href="https://github.com/plantbreeding/documentation">Github wiki</a>.

### URL structure

API requests are structured as "\<server\>/brapi/v1/", 
where "v1" is the version number of the API, followed by the command.  
Example: /brapi/v1/markerprofiles/2939 

To distinguish between multiple databases or crops available from the same server, include the database or crop name as part of the "\<server\>" identifier.

Example: superBreedingServer.org/maize/brapi/v1/markerprofiles/2939

### Structure of the response object:
The return objects are encoded in JSON. 
The response always consists of a "metadata" key that minimally 
contains the pagination information in a "pagination" key and the status information as well as a "datafiles" key that lists URLs to data files generated by the call.

If the response is a single record that doesn't require pagination, then the value for the "pagination" key is an empty hash.  When the results are paginated, 
the pagination object contains the keys "pageSize", "currentPage", "totalCount", "totalPages". The first page will be page 0 (zero).

The status object contains an object with the keys "message" and "exception". The message should be user readable, and the exception should give further details, with recommended keys "type", "href", and "details". 

The payload data is contained in a key called "result". This should usually contain a list; pagination will happen over items in this list.

See especially the [Best Practices and Conventions]
(https://github.com/plantbreeding/documentation/wiki/Best-Practices-and-Conventions).

### HTTP error codes

HTTP error codes are used as required, e.g., 200 for ok, 404 for page not found, 401 for not authorized, 501 for not implemented, 201 for created in a PUT, 202 for request received but not yet processed, etc.

### API call categories:  
Scope: "CORE", "PHENOTYPING", "GENOTYPING", "OTHER".  
Status: "STABLE", "ACCEPTED", "IN DISCUSSION", "SUGGESTED".
